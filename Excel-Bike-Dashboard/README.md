## üîë Key Insights & Findings

The dashboard allows for the exploration of several critical insights:

* **Average Income per Purchase:** Analysis reveals a clear difference in average income between customers who purchased a bike (**Yes**) and those who did not (**No**), further segmented by Gender. This helps in identifying income brackets most likely to convert.
* **Customer Age Brackets:** Clear purchasing behavior trends are observed across age segments (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old), identifying the age groups most likely to convert.
* **Customer Commute Distance:** Visualization demonstrates a strong correlation between a customer's daily **commute distance** (e.g., 0-1 Miles vs. 10+ Miles) and their decision to purchase a bicycle, suggesting varying needs based on lifestyle.
* **Interactive Filtering:** The dashboard provides instant filtering capabilities across key demographic dimensions (**Marital Status, Region, Education, Number of Children**) to enable deep-dive analysis by region or segment.
